# Analyzing Contributors to Heart Disease
## A codecademy Project

**Objective:** Investigate data from a sample of patients who were evaluated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. 

Use visualizations and hypothesis testing to evaluate correlations between variables. Incorporate SciPy and Statsmodels to test for statistical significance.

The data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and then cleaned for analysis.
